JUSTICE K. KANNAN1. Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgment ? No2. To be referred to the Reporters or not ? No3. Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest? No-.-K. KANNAN J.1. The petitioner challenges the order of the Ministry of External Affairs through Passport Officerrejecting petitioner's application for grant of passport. The impugned order makes reference to theMinistry's reply dated 16.06.2010 that proposed to deny to the petitioner a favourableconsideration. The contention in the writ petition is that the provision for appeal itself is made onlyin respect of circumstances that result in denial of passport under Section 6(2) (b),  (c) and (d) ofPassport Act,  and the impugned order,  being one which falls outside the scope of the aboveprovisions,  the writ petition was being filed.2. The petitioner would contend that there are no proper reasons spelt out in the order as to why,  hewas being denied the passport. The State has filed its reply contending that the petitioner had beenAmarjit Singh Son Gurmit Singh vs Union Of India And Others on 1 December,  2011Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158509199/1], [associated with a terrorist outfit and in the year 1989,  he had gone to New Zealand and later toPakistan in the year 1994 from New Zealand. During his stay in Pakistan,  he had been engaged inpromotion of insurrection against Government of India via radio and in the year 1996 when he wastrying to enter into India through Kathmandu,  he had been apprehended by the concerned police.All these facts would prove that the petitioner had been engaging in activities that endangered thesolidarity and security of India. As a matter of record,  the 3rd respondent would also said that a casehad been registered against the petitioner in FIR No.133 dated 06.09.1996 for alleged offencesunder Sections 121,  121-A,  122,  123,  124-A IPC and under Sections 3,  4 and 5 Explosive Act andunder Section 25,  27,  54,  59 Arms Act at Kharar,  District Ropar but he was later acquitted by theAdditional District Judge,  Ropar. He had been earlier registered for a case in FIR No.47 dated19.04.1988 under Sections 307,  302,  34 IPC but discharged by the trial Court. The principalcontention on behalf of the State is,  therefore,  that the petitioner who had been connected withterrorist group and engaging in anit-India activities could not be given the passport.3. The reply of the Union reiterates the contentions taken by the State and makes an issue of the factthat the petitioner had been formerly the President of the International Sikh Youth Federation(Bittoo),  New Zealand. It is also stated that the impugned order has been passed rejecting thepetitioner's claim for a passport on the grounds set forth under Section 6(2)(b) and(c) and there is a provision for appeal and the reading of the provisions as set out by the petitioner isnot correct. The respondent would explain that their own denial of passport to the petitioner was onaccount of the fact that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined the issue of passport to thepetitioner. Since the order of the petitioner says no more than the fact that the Ministry of ForeignAffairs declined the issue of passport and the reply also stated no more than that the Ministrydeclined the passport,  it became necessary to secure better details and I had called upon the Unionto produce in a sealed cover any classified information relating to the intelligence report onpetitioner only to satisfy myself that the ultimate decision had some tangible basis,  without stillcompromising on national security issues.4. A sealed envelop had been produced on 11.11.2011 and I had urged the learned counsel for thepetitioner to make his submission on an issue of how the petitioner could make a claim for issuanceof a passport if there were security issues and the extent of the information that the petitioner couldseek relating to secret classified information that the Government might have against the petitioner.Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner states that it is undeniable that if there is anymaterial to say that he had been engaged in any activity prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrityof India and the presence of the petitioner in any foreing country was likely to be detrimental to thesecurity of India or prejudicial to the friendly relations of India with any other country,  the passportcould be definitely refused. The petitioner would concede that he had set up a radio broadcast inNew Zealand and he had definitely broadcast information that there were serious human rightviolations taking place in India and the minorities rights were being trampled upon. This,  accordingto him,  was very much within his freedom of right of expression and free speech and the activitymust be seen only as a democratic expression and permissible by the width of freedom guaranteedunder Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution. According to him,  ever since his return to India,  he hasbeen always under the state surveillance and there was not any one incident where any of hisAmarjit Singh Son Gurmit Singh vs Union Of India And Others on 1 December,  2011Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158509199/2], [activities came under cloud. The cases that he had been registered against him had also vindicatedhis innocence.5. Learned counsel would further submit that the State need not necessarily disclose secretinformation which they might to hold but there could be nothing against him,  which he himself doesnot know. There is nothing likely to be said against the petitioner except his past involvement whenhe was in New Zealand having some radio broadcast and present denial ought to be possible only ifhis activities still go to cause any prejudice to the national interest. The information supplied to theCourt recalls his past activities in New Zealand,  Pakistan and Nepal and claims that he has stillcontacts with some hard-core terrorists. Terrorist activities are a global menace and by the verynature of activities,  they are done covertly before they fulminate to large scale destruction andmayhem. It is not possible for me to see that the information shared with the Court has anythingsubstantial but lines have to be clearly drawn between what State in its executive wisdom decides todo or what the Court could compel any public authority to do. The task of taking a decision for grantof passport is entrusted with Officers,  who have sensitive duties to perform in certain cases. ThePassport Officer himself could not have done anything beyond putting it through the Ministry ofForeign Affairs since the State recommendations did not come in his favour and the State had giveninformation about his past terrorist links and if the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not prepared totake his conduct as not irrelevant and his own present links were still perceive as suspicious,  it shallnot become possible for me to still override their objections and direct an issue of passport. All thatcould be done is to see whether the decision has come after following the process,  which is laid downby law. The reasonableness of restriction is always a subject of appraisal by the Court. Thedispensation in Menka Gandhi Vs. Union of India 1978 1 SCC 248 is a significant sign post inunderstanding the content of reasonableness in restrictions. In the felicitous expressions of theHon'ble Supreme Court: \"personal liberty makes for the worth of the human person. Travel makesliberty worthwhile. Life is a terrestrial opportunity for unfolding personality rising to a higher scalemoving to fresh woods and reaching out to reality which makes our earthly journey a truefulfillment...The spirit of Man is at the root of Artcile 21. Absent liberty,  other freedoms are frozen...The freedom of foreign travel,  which is included under Article 21 can be fettered or forbidden byprocedure established by law but the quality of fairness in procedure is emphasized by the strongword established which means settled firmly not wantonly or whimsical. If it is rooted in the legalconsciousness of the community it becomes 'established' procedure...The compulsion ofconstitutional humanism and the assumption of full faith in life and liberty cannot be so futile orfragmentary that any transient legislative majority in tantrums against any minority,  by three quickreadings of a bill with the requisite quorum can prescribe any unreasonable modality and therebysterilise the grandiloquent mandate...Procedure which deals with the modalities of regulating, restricting or even rejecting a fundamental right falling within Article 21 has to be fair,  not foolish, carefully designed to effectuate,  not to subvert the substantive right itself. Thus understood, 'procedure' must rule out anything arbitrary,  freakish or bizarre..6. In this case,  there is reasonably a fair procedure adopted. When the State did not recommend theissue of passport by the past links of the petitioner with terrorists' outfit and his own activities,  theywere perceived as causing disaffection against the integrity and solidarity of India,  the PassportOfficer had sought for the Ministry's views in the matter. The Ministry has given the crypticAmarjit Singh Son Gurmit Singh vs Union Of India And Others on 1 December,  2011Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158509199/3], [information that by their own intelligence and with the available information,  they will notrecommend the issuance of passport.7. Even when the Menaka Gandhi's case (supra) made a significant stride in understanding thatright to personal freedom guaranteed under Article 21 cannot be merely a satisfaction that there wasa law which restricted any of the freedoms and then the reasonableness of such restriction itself willbe a matter for judicial appraisal,  it was said again in the context of how even earlier in SatwantSingh Sawhney Vs. D. Ramarathnam 1967 (3) SCR 525 ,  the Supreme Court had ruled by majoritythat the expression \"personal liberty\" which occurs under Article 21 of the Constitution includes theright to travel abroad and no person can be deprived of that right except the procedure establishedby law. The Passport Act which was enacted by Parliament in 1967 in order to comply with thatdecision prescribes a procedure whereby an application by the passport may be granted fully orpartially with or without endorsement and the passport once granted may later be revoked orimpounded. But the mere prescription of some kind of procedure cannot ever meet the mandate ofArticle 21. The procedure prescribed by law be fair,  just and reasonable and not fanciful appraisal orarbitrary. There is no dispute now that the grounds for refusal of a passport,  as spelt out throughSection 6 itself,  are not in challenge. If a person may or is likely to engage in activities prejudicial,  apassport could be denied. It is not merely that a person must be actually engaging in activitiesprejudicial. The possibility of what he could do is also relevant. What a person could do in future isinvariably measured by what he had done already. While it is easy to philosophise that every day is anew day blossomed and every future activity could be unsullied by diabolical past deeds,  authoritiesimpressed with the duty to verify the antecedents could verify only the past. Verification of a futurecould never be a human endeavour except for the person,  who plans for his future. If any objectiveassessment were to be made on a subject by the State,  it has to inevitably be what the past activitieshave been. It is just as well likely that a person has turned to a new leaf or perhaps,  he has carriedconviction that what he already did was nothing wrong. They are bound to be varying perceptionsbut at least I have satisfied myself that it is not merely some whimsical official fiat that runssupreme here. It has gone through a process before a letter of rejection was handed down to thepetitioner.8. While Section 6 sets out the grounds when a passport could be refused,  it is Section 5 which dealswith the exercise of power through application for a passport. Section 5(2) deals with the exercise ofthat power that results in issue of passport or travel document with endorsement and that includesmaking an endorsement that would include the refusal to make an endorsement on the passport ortravel document. Sub section (3) states that where a Passport Authority makes an order underClause (b) or (c) under Sub-Section (2) on the application of any person,  it shall record in writingevery statement of its reasons for making such order and furnish to that person on demand a copy ofthe same unless in any case the passport authority is of the opinion that it will not be in the interestsof the sovereignty and integrity of India,  the security of India,  friendly relations of India with anyforeign country or in the interests of the general public to furnish such copy. The additional powergiven under Section 5(3) is that in cases where a refusal is made on issues of activities contractedwith the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India,  reasons in writing need not be given. Ineither case,  a refusal that takes place does not come under Section 6. It is done only under SectionAmarjit Singh Son Gurmit Singh vs Union Of India And Others on 1 December,  2011Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158509199/4], [5. Section 11 of the Passport Act enables any person aggrieved by the order of the Passport Authorityunder Clause (b) or (c) of Sub Section 2 of Section 5 to prefer an appeal. In every case where apassport is refused on any of the grounds under clause (b) or (c) of Sub-Section (2),  such a personhas always a remedy under Section11. Indeed,  the Union has filed the counter stating that proper procedure must have been only toprefer an appeal and not to challenge the same before this Court. I would find an additional reasonnot to interfere with the decision only because the petitioner has not fully exhausted his remedy bypreferring an appeal and he has opted for a writ petition by a reading of Section 11,  which,  in myview,  is not correct. Even while dismissing the writ petition,  I would still give an opportunity to thepetitioner to prefer an appeal against the decision communicated to him so that the case obtainsfresh appraisal by the authority constituted under the Act.9. The writ petition is disposed of as above.(K.

The principalcontention on behalf of the State is,  therefore,  that the petitioner who had been connected withterrorist group and engaging in anit-India activities could not be given the passport.3. The reply of the Union reiterates the contentions taken by the State and makes an issue of the factthat the petitioner had been formerly the President of the International Sikh Youth Federation(Bittoo),  New Zealand. It is also stated that the impugned order has been passed rejecting thepetitioner's claim for a passport on the grounds set forth under Section 6(2)(b) and(c) and there is a provision for appeal and the reading of the provisions as set out by the petitioner isnot correct. The respondent would explain that their own denial of passport to the petitioner was onaccount of the fact that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined the issue of passport to thepetitioner. Since the order of the petitioner says no more than the fact that the Ministry of ForeignAffairs declined the issue of passport and the reply also stated no more than that the Ministrydeclined the passport,  it became necessary to secure better details and I had called upon the Unionto produce in a sealed cover any classified information relating to the intelligence report onpetitioner only to satisfy myself that the ultimate decision had some tangible basis,  without stillcompromising on national security issues.4. A sealed envelop had been produced on 11.11.2011 and I had urged the learned counsel for thepetitioner to make his submission on an issue of how the petitioner could make a claim for issuanceof a passport if there were security issues and the extent of the information that the petitioner couldseek relating to secret classified information that the Government might have against the petitioner.Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner states that it is undeniable that if there is anymaterial to say that he had been engaged in any activity prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrityof India and the presence of the petitioner in any foreing country was likely to be detrimental to thesecurity of India or prejudicial to the friendly relations of India with any other country,  the passportcould be definitely refused. The petitioner would concede that he had set up a radio broadcast inNew Zealand and he had definitely broadcast information that there were serious human rightviolations taking place in India and the minorities rights were being trampled upon. This,  accordingto him,  was very much within his freedom of right of expression and free speech and the activitymust be seen only as a democratic expression and permissible by the width of freedom guaranteedunder Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution. According to him,  ever since his return to India,  he hasbeen always under the state surveillance and there was not any one incident where any of hisAmarjit Singh Son Gurmit Singh vs Union Of India And Others on 1 December,  2011Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158509199/2], [activities came under cloud. The cases that he had been registered against him had also vindicatedhis innocence.5. Learned counsel would further submit that the State need not necessarily disclose secretinformation which they might to hold but there could be nothing against him,  which he himself doesnot know. There is nothing likely to be said against the petitioner except his past involvement whenhe was in New Zealand having some radio broadcast and present denial ought to be possible only ifhis activities still go to cause any prejudice to the national interest. The information supplied to theCourt recalls his past activities in New Zealand,  Pakistan and Nepal and claims that he has stillcontacts with some hard-core terrorists. Terrorist activities are a global menace and by the verynature of activities,  they are done covertly before they fulminate to large scale destruction andmayhem. It is not possible for me to see that the information shared with the Court has anythingsubstantial but lines have to be clearly drawn between what State in its executive wisdom decides todo or what the Court could compel any public authority to do. The task of taking a decision for grantof passport is entrusted with Officers,  who have sensitive duties to perform in certain cases. ThePassport Officer himself could not have done anything beyond putting it through the Ministry ofForeign Affairs since the State recommendations did not come in his favour and the State had giveninformation about his past terrorist links and if the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not prepared totake his conduct as not irrelevant and his own present links were still perceive as suspicious,  it shallnot become possible for me to still override their objections and direct an issue of passport. All thatcould be done is to see whether the decision has come after following the process,  which is laid downby law. The reasonableness of restriction is always a subject of appraisal by the Court. Thedispensation in Menka Gandhi Vs. Union of India 1978 1 SCC 248 is a significant sign post inunderstanding the content of reasonableness in restrictions. In the felicitous expressions of theHon'ble Supreme Court: \"personal liberty makes for the worth of the human person. Travel makesliberty worthwhile. Life is a terrestrial opportunity for unfolding personality rising to a higher scalemoving to fresh woods and reaching out to reality which makes our earthly journey a truefulfillment...The spirit of Man is at the root of Artcile 21. Absent liberty,  other freedoms are frozen...The freedom of foreign travel,  which is included under Article 21 can be fettered or forbidden byprocedure established by law but the quality of fairness in procedure is emphasized by the strongword established which means settled firmly not wantonly or whimsical. If it is rooted in the legalconsciousness of the community it becomes 'established' procedure...The compulsion ofconstitutional humanism and the assumption of full faith in life and liberty cannot be so futile orfragmentary that any transient legislative majority in tantrums against any minority,  by three quickreadings of a bill with the requisite quorum can prescribe any unreasonable modality and therebysterilise the grandiloquent mandate...Procedure which deals with the modalities of regulating, restricting or even rejecting a fundamental right falling within Article 21 has to be fair,  not foolish, carefully designed to effectuate,  not to subvert the substantive right itself. Thus understood, 'procedure' must rule out anything arbitrary,  freakish or bizarre..6. In this case,  there is reasonably a fair procedure adopted. When the State did not recommend theissue of passport by the past links of the petitioner with terrorists' outfit and his own activities,  theywere perceived as causing disaffection against the integrity and solidarity of India,  the PassportOfficer had sought for the Ministry's views in the matter. The Ministry has given the crypticAmarjit Singh Son Gurmit Singh vs Union Of India And Others on 1 December,  2011Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158509199/3], [information that by their own intelligence and with the available information,  they will notrecommend the issuance of passport.7. Even when the Menaka Gandhi's case (supra) made a significant stride in understanding thatright to personal freedom guaranteed under Article 21 cannot be merely a satisfaction that there wasa law which restricted any of the freedoms and then the reasonableness of such restriction itself willbe a matter for judicial appraisal,  it was said again in the context of how even earlier in SatwantSingh Sawhney Vs. D. Ramarathnam 1967 (3) SCR 525 ,  the Supreme Court had ruled by majoritythat the expression \"personal liberty\" which occurs under Article 21 of the Constitution includes theright to travel abroad and no person can be deprived of that right except the procedure establishedby law. The Passport Act which was enacted by Parliament in 1967 in order to comply with thatdecision prescribes a procedure whereby an application by the passport may be granted fully orpartially with or without endorsement and the passport once granted may later be revoked orimpounded. But the mere prescription of some kind of procedure cannot ever meet the mandate ofArticle 21. The procedure prescribed by law be fair,  just and reasonable and not fanciful appraisal orarbitrary. There is no dispute now that the grounds for refusal of a passport,  as spelt out throughSection 6 itself,  are not in challenge. If a person may or is likely to engage in activities prejudicial,  apassport could be denied. It is not merely that a person must be actually engaging in activitiesprejudicial. The possibility of what he could do is also relevant. What a person could do in future isinvariably measured by what he had done already. While it is easy to philosophise that every day is anew day blossomed and every future activity could be unsullied by diabolical past deeds,  authoritiesimpressed with the duty to verify the antecedents could verify only the past. Verification of a futurecould never be a human endeavour except for the person,  who plans for his future. If any objectiveassessment were to be made on a subject by the State,  it has to inevitably be what the past activitieshave been. It is just as well likely that a person has turned to a new leaf or perhaps,  he has carriedconviction that what he already did was nothing wrong. They are bound to be varying perceptionsbut at least I have satisfied myself that it is not merely some whimsical official fiat that runssupreme here. It has gone through a process before a letter of rejection was handed down to thepetitioner.8. While Section 6 sets out the grounds when a passport could be refused,  it is Section 5 which dealswith the exercise of power through application for a passport. Section 5(2) deals with the exercise ofthat power that results in issue of passport or travel document with endorsement and that includesmaking an endorsement that would include the refusal to make an endorsement on the passport ortravel document. Sub section (3) states that where a Passport Authority makes an order underClause (b) or (c) under Sub-Section (2) on the application of any person,  it shall record in writingevery statement of its reasons for making such order and furnish to that person on demand a copy ofthe same unless in any case the passport authority is of the opinion that it will not be in the interestsof the sovereignty and integrity of India,  the security of India,  friendly relations of India with anyforeign country or in the interests of the general public to furnish such copy. The additional powergiven under Section 5(3) is that in cases where a refusal is made on issues of activities contractedwith the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India,  reasons in writing need not be given. Ineither case,  a refusal that takes place does not come under Section 6. It is done only under SectionAmarjit Singh Son Gurmit Singh vs Union Of India And Others on 1 December,  2011Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158509199/4], [5. Section 11 of the Passport Act enables any person aggrieved by the order of the Passport Authorityunder Clause (b) or (c) of Sub Section 2 of Section 5 to prefer an appeal. In every case where apassport is refused on any of the grounds under clause (b) or (c) of Sub-Section (2),  such a personhas always a remedy under Section11. Indeed,  the Union has filed the counter stating that proper procedure must have been only toprefer an appeal and not to challenge the same before this Court. I would find an additional reasonnot to interfere with the decision only because the petitioner has not fully exhausted his remedy bypreferring an appeal and he has opted for a writ petition by a reading of Section 11,  which,  in myview,  is not correct. Even while dismissing the writ petition,  I would still give an opportunity to thepetitioner to prefer an appeal against the decision communicated to him so that the case obtainsfresh appraisal by the authority constituted under the Act.9.

The impugned order makes reference to theMinistry's reply dated 16.06.2010 that proposed to deny to the petitioner a favourableconsideration. The contention in the writ petition is that the provision for appeal itself is made onlyin respect of circumstances that result in denial of passport under Section 6(2) (b),  (c) and (d) ofPassport Act,  and the impugned order,  being one which falls outside the scope of the aboveprovisions,  the writ petition was being filed.2. The petitioner would contend that there are no proper reasons spelt out in the order as to why,  hewas being denied the passport. The State has filed its reply contending that the petitioner had beenAmarjit Singh Son Gurmit Singh vs Union Of India And Others on 1 December,  2011Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158509199/1], [associated with a terrorist outfit and in the year 1989,  he had gone to New Zealand and later toPakistan in the year 1994 from New Zealand. During his stay in Pakistan,  he had been engaged inpromotion of insurrection against Government of India via radio and in the year 1996 when he wastrying to enter into India through Kathmandu,  he had been apprehended by the concerned police.All these facts would prove that the petitioner had been engaging in activities that endangered thesolidarity and security of India. As a matter of record,  the 3rd respondent would also said that a casehad been registered against the petitioner in FIR No.133 dated 06.09.1996 for alleged offencesunder Sections 121,  121-A,  122,  123,  124-A IPC and under Sections 3,  4 and 5 Explosive Act andunder Section 25,  27,  54,  59 Arms Act at Kharar,  District Ropar but he was later acquitted by theAdditional District Judge,  Ropar.

This,  accordingto him,  was very much within his freedom of right of expression and free speech and the activitymust be seen only as a democratic expression and permissible by the width of freedom guaranteedunder Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution. According to him,  ever since his return to India,  he hasbeen always under the state surveillance and there was not any one incident where any of hisAmarjit Singh Son Gurmit Singh vs Union Of India And Others on 1 December,  2011Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158509199/2], [activities came under cloud. The cases that he had been registered against him had also vindicatedhis innocence.5. Learned counsel would further submit that the State need not necessarily disclose secretinformation which they might to hold but there could be nothing against him,  which he himself doesnot know. There is nothing likely to be said against the petitioner except his past involvement whenhe was in New Zealand having some radio broadcast and present denial ought to be possible only ifhis activities still go to cause any prejudice to the national interest. The information supplied to theCourt recalls his past activities in New Zealand,  Pakistan and Nepal and claims that he has stillcontacts with some hard-core terrorists. Terrorist activities are a global menace and by the verynature of activities,  they are done covertly before they fulminate to large scale destruction andmayhem. It is not possible for me to see that the information shared with the Court has anythingsubstantial but lines have to be clearly drawn between what State in its executive wisdom decides todo or what the Court could compel any public authority to do. The task of taking a decision for grantof passport is entrusted with Officers,  who have sensitive duties to perform in certain cases. ThePassport Officer himself could not have done anything beyond putting it through the Ministry ofForeign Affairs since the State recommendations did not come in his favour and the State had giveninformation about his past terrorist links and if the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not prepared totake his conduct as not irrelevant and his own present links were still perceive as suspicious,  it shallnot become possible for me to still override their objections and direct an issue of passport. All thatcould be done is to see whether the decision has come after following the process,  which is laid downby law. The reasonableness of restriction is always a subject of appraisal by the Court. Thedispensation in Menka Gandhi Vs. Union of India 1978 1 SCC 248 is a significant sign post inunderstanding the content of reasonableness in restrictions. In the felicitous expressions of theHon'ble Supreme Court: \"personal liberty makes for the worth of the human person. Travel makesliberty worthwhile. Life is a terrestrial opportunity for unfolding personality rising to a higher scalemoving to fresh woods and reaching out to reality which makes our earthly journey a truefulfillment...The spirit of Man is at the root of Artcile 21.

Thus understood, 'procedure' must rule out anything arbitrary,  freakish or bizarre..6. In this case,  there is reasonably a fair procedure adopted. When the State did not recommend theissue of passport by the past links of the petitioner with terrorists' outfit and his own activities,  theywere perceived as causing disaffection against the integrity and solidarity of India,  the PassportOfficer had sought for the Ministry's views in the matter. The Ministry has given the crypticAmarjit Singh Son Gurmit Singh vs Union Of India And Others on 1 December,  2011Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158509199/3], [information that by their own intelligence and with the available information,  they will notrecommend the issuance of passport.7. Even when the Menaka Gandhi's case (supra) made a significant stride in understanding thatright to personal freedom guaranteed under Article 21 cannot be merely a satisfaction that there wasa law which restricted any of the freedoms and then the reasonableness of such restriction itself willbe a matter for judicial appraisal,  it was said again in the context of how even earlier in SatwantSingh Sawhney Vs. D. Ramarathnam 1967 (3) SCR 525 ,  the Supreme Court had ruled by majoritythat the expression \"personal liberty\" which occurs under Article 21 of the Constitution includes theright to travel abroad and no person can be deprived of that right except the procedure establishedby law. The Passport Act which was enacted by Parliament in 1967 in order to comply with thatdecision prescribes a procedure whereby an application by the passport may be granted fully orpartially with or without endorsement and the passport once granted may later be revoked orimpounded. But the mere prescription of some kind of procedure cannot ever meet the mandate ofArticle 21. The procedure prescribed by law be fair,  just and reasonable and not fanciful appraisal orarbitrary. There is no dispute now that the grounds for refusal of a passport,  as spelt out throughSection 6 itself,  are not in challenge. If a person may or is likely to engage in activities prejudicial,  apassport could be denied. It is not merely that a person must be actually engaging in activitiesprejudicial. The possibility of what he could do is also relevant. What a person could do in future isinvariably measured by what he had done already. While it is easy to philosophise that every day is anew day blossomed and every future activity could be unsullied by diabolical past deeds,  authoritiesimpressed with the duty to verify the antecedents could verify only the past. Verification of a futurecould never be a human endeavour except for the person,  who plans for his future. If any objectiveassessment were to be made on a subject by the State,  it has to inevitably be what the past activitieshave been. It is just as well likely that a person has turned to a new leaf or perhaps,  he has carriedconviction that what he already did was nothing wrong. They are bound to be varying perceptionsbut at least I have satisfied myself that it is not merely some whimsical official fiat that runssupreme here. It has gone through a process before a letter of rejection was handed down to thepetitioner.8. While Section 6 sets out the grounds when a passport could be refused,  it is Section 5 which dealswith the exercise of power through application for a passport. Section 5(2) deals with the exercise ofthat power that results in issue of passport or travel document with endorsement and that includesmaking an endorsement that would include the refusal to make an endorsement on the passport ortravel document. Sub section (3) states that where a Passport Authority makes an order underClause (b) or (c) under Sub-Section (2) on the application of any person,  it shall record in writingevery statement of its reasons for making such order and furnish to that person on demand a copy ofthe same unless in any case the passport authority is of the opinion that it will not be in the interestsof the sovereignty and integrity of India,  the security of India,  friendly relations of India with anyforeign country or in the interests of the general public to furnish such copy. The additional powergiven under Section 5(3) is that in cases where a refusal is made on issues of activities contractedwith the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India,  reasons in writing need not be given. Ineither case,  a refusal that takes place does not come under Section 6. It is done only under SectionAmarjit Singh Son Gurmit Singh vs Union Of India And Others on 1 December,  2011Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158509199/4], [5. Section 11 of the Passport Act enables any person aggrieved by the order of the Passport Authorityunder Clause (b) or (c) of Sub Section 2 of Section 5 to prefer an appeal. In every case where apassport is refused on any of the grounds under clause (b) or (c) of Sub-Section (2),  such a personhas always a remedy under Section11. Indeed,  the Union has filed the counter stating that proper procedure must have been only toprefer an appeal and not to challenge the same before this Court. I would find an additional reasonnot to interfere with the decision only because the petitioner has not fully exhausted his remedy bypreferring an appeal and he has opted for a writ petition by a reading of Section 11,  which,  in myview,  is not correct. Even while dismissing the writ petition,  I would still give an opportunity to thepetitioner to prefer an appeal against the decision communicated to him so that the case obtainsfresh appraisal by the authority constituted under the Act.9. The writ petition is disposed of as above.(K.

JUSTICE K. KANNAN1. Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgment ? No2. To be referred to the Reporters or not ? No3. Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest? No-.-K. KANNAN J.1. The petitioner challenges the order of the Ministry of External Affairs through Passport Officerrejecting petitioner's application for grant of passport. The impugned order makes reference to theMinistry's reply dated 16.06.2010 that proposed to deny to the petitioner a favourableconsideration. The contention in the writ petition is that the provision for appeal itself is made onlyin respect of circumstances that result in denial of passport under Section 6(2) (b),  (c) and (d) ofPassport Act,  and the impugned order,  being one which falls outside the scope of the aboveprovisions,  the writ petition was being filed.2. The petitioner would contend that there are no proper reasons spelt out in the order as to why,  hewas being denied the passport. The State has filed its reply contending that the petitioner had beenAmarjit Singh Son Gurmit Singh vs Union Of India And Others on 1 December,  2011Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158509199/1], [associated with a terrorist outfit and in the year 1989,  he had gone to New Zealand and later toPakistan in the year 1994 from New Zealand. During his stay in Pakistan,  he had been engaged inpromotion of insurrection against Government of India via radio and in the year 1996 when he wastrying to enter into India through Kathmandu,  he had been apprehended by the concerned police.All these facts would prove that the petitioner had been engaging in activities that endangered thesolidarity and security of India. As a matter of record,  the 3rd respondent would also said that a casehad been registered against the petitioner in FIR No.133 dated 06.09.1996 for alleged offencesunder Sections 121,  121-A,  122,  123,  124-A IPC and under Sections 3,  4 and 5 Explosive Act andunder Section 25,  27,  54,  59 Arms Act at Kharar,  District Ropar but he was later acquitted by theAdditional District Judge,  Ropar. He had been earlier registered for a case in FIR No.47 dated19.04.1988 under Sections 307,  302,  34 IPC but discharged by the trial Court. The principalcontention on behalf of the State is,  therefore,  that the petitioner who had been connected withterrorist group and engaging in anit-India activities could not be given the passport.3. The reply of the Union reiterates the contentions taken by the State and makes an issue of the factthat the petitioner had been formerly the President of the International Sikh Youth Federation(Bittoo),  New Zealand. It is also stated that the impugned order has been passed rejecting thepetitioner's claim for a passport on the grounds set forth under Section 6(2)(b) and(c) and there is a provision for appeal and the reading of the provisions as set out by the petitioner isnot correct. The respondent would explain that their own denial of passport to the petitioner was onaccount of the fact that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined the issue of passport to thepetitioner. Since the order of the petitioner says no more than the fact that the Ministry of ForeignAffairs declined the issue of passport and the reply also stated no more than that the Ministrydeclined the passport,  it became necessary to secure better details and I had called upon the Unionto produce in a sealed cover any classified information relating to the intelligence report onpetitioner only to satisfy myself that the ultimate decision had some tangible basis,  without stillcompromising on national security issues.4. A sealed envelop had been produced on 11.11.2011 and I had urged the learned counsel for thepetitioner to make his submission on an issue of how the petitioner could make a claim for issuanceof a passport if there were security issues and the extent of the information that the petitioner couldseek relating to secret classified information that the Government might have against the petitioner.Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner states that it is undeniable that if there is anymaterial to say that he had been engaged in any activity prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrityof India and the presence of the petitioner in any foreing country was likely to be detrimental to thesecurity of India or prejudicial to the friendly relations of India with any other country,  the passportcould be definitely refused.

The petitioner has challenged order bearing No. DCK/Suspension-Councillor/2020-2 dated25.06.2020', ' passed by respondent No. 5', ' whereby the petitioner has been suspended fromdischarging his functions as councilor of Hill Development Council', ' Kargil. The stay of orderimpugned as measure of interim relief is sought for by the petitioner. The reply to the petition hasbeen filed on behalf of the respondents.2. The petitioner has been elected as Councillor of Shakar constituency of LAHDC', ' Kargil. It ispleaded by the petitioner that FIR came to be lodged against the petitioner on false allegations. Thebail application filed by the petitioner was allowed by this Court on the ground that prima facie theessential elements of law are not attracted in the present case. The contention raised by thepetitioner is that the respondent No. 5 has no power to suspend the petitioner as councillor as perLadakh Autonomous Hill 2 WP(C) 1645/2020 CM No. 4635/2020 Development Councils', ' Act(hereinafter called the Act) and therefore the order passed is without jurisdiction. It is furthercontended that the Act does not provide suspension of councillor from the Council. Despiterepresentation made by the petitioner the revocation of suspension of the petitioner has not takenplace which has compelled the petitioner to file the present writ petition.3. In the objections filed by the respondents it is submitted that the executive Council in its meetingheld on 20.06.2020 under the Chairmanship of Chief Executive Councillor LAHDC', ' Kargilsuspended the petitioner and suspension order was passed on the recommendation ofChairman/CEO LAHDC. FIR No. 34/2020 was lodged against the petitioner under Sections 124A', 'Zakir Hussain vs Union Territory Of J&amp;K And Others on 4 December', ' 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/162108487/1'], ['153B', ' 505(2) and 188 IPC by the police Station', ' Kargil on the basis of objectionable audio clipcontaining seditious and proactive conversation and imputation and rumors against the Armystand-off with Chinese Army in Ladakh which was found to be prejudicial to the tranquility andsecurity of the nation. The petitioner was in conversation with one Nisar Hussain in this regard. It isfurther contended that Section 24 of Jammu and Kashmir Representation of the People Act', ' 1957regards disloyalty to the State as one of the grounds for suspension of petitioner under Section 17 ofLAHDC Act.4. Heard learned counsel for the parties.5. Indeed', \" the learned counsels for both sides have advanced the arguments in tune with theirrespective pleadings. In order to appreciate the grievance of the petitioner qua the order impugnedin the petition it is profitable to analyze if the Act provides for suspension of the Councillor from thecouncil. In case the reply is to be in affirmative the next question for 3 WP(C) 1645/2020 CM No.4635/2020 determination is if the order impugned has been passed by the competent authority interms of the Act.6. Section 19 of the Act speaks of removal of the Member of the Council on the grounds mentionedtherein. The grounds on which the member can be removed are: the member is convicted by anyCourt for an offence involving moral turpitude punishable with imprisonment for a period of morethan six months or he has been adjudged as insolvent or he has become physically or mentallyincapable of acting as a member and lastly if has acquired such financial or other interests which islikely to affect prejudicially his functions as a member. The clauses of the said Section do not admitof the removal of the member of Council on any other ground except on the grounds mentionedtherein. The court has gone through the provisions of the Act and finds no provision in the Actwhich expressly provides for suspension of the member of the Council. Once there is no provisionfor suspension of the member from the Council then irrespective of the reason which the competentauthority may consider sufficient for suspension of the member cannot suspend the member fromthe Council. The suspension cannot be equated with removal. Even if it is considered for the sake ofarguments that 'removal' encompasses the 'suspension' the reasons for suspension cannot bebeyond the clauses mentioned in Section 19 of the Act. The court cannot look beyond to what isprovided in the Act. If the provisions of the Act do not expressly or even impliedly provide forsuspension of the member from the Council than in that case the court is not required to expand theprovisions so as to hold that the provisions of the Act provide for suspension of the member fromthe Council.                                       4                  WP(C) 1645/2020                                                         CM No. 4635/20207. The petitioner has further pleaded that the petitioner has not been\", ' in any case', ' suspended by thecompetent authority if it is to be presumed for the sake of argument that the person/authorityZakir Hussain vs Union Territory Of J&amp;K And Others on 4 December', ' 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/162108487/2'], ['having power to remove the member can also suspend the member from the Council. The other sidehas contended that the order of suspension of the petitioner was passed by the respondent No. 5 onthe recommendation of the Chairman/Chief Executive Councillor in pursuance to the decision takenby the executive Council in its meeting held on 20.06.2020. The court is again required to revert tothe provisions of the Act. Section 23 pertains to the matters under the control and administration ofthe Council. The powers which the Council can exercise are clearly delineated in the clauses (i) to(xxvii) of the said section. In addition', ' the government can confer other powers upon the Council.Again', ' the court finds no such power is vested in the Council to remove its member from theCouncil. In fact the power of removal of member from the Council lies within the domain of thegovernment and no other authority in terms of Section 19 of the Act. Section 28 of the Act prescribespowers', ' functions and duties of the Chairman of the Council. As per the Section the Chairman canpreside over the meeting of the councilor and is also responsible for the maintenance of the recordof the Council. Further', ' he can perform such other functions and discharge such other duties as theCouncil may', ' by general or special resolution', ' direct. The other provision which may be required tobe looked into for the purpose of discussion is Section 38 of the Act. Deputy Commissioner of thedistrict is the Chief Executive Officer of the Councillor. Section 38(2) provides that the ChiefExecutive Officer can be present at the meeting of the Council', ' the Executive Council and can alsotake part in the proceedings of such meeting but he has no right to vote during the proceedings ofthe meetings. What is 5 WP(C) 1645/2020 CM No. 4635/2020 fathomed from various provisions ofthe Act is that neither the Council nor the Chairman of the Council nor the Chief Executive Officer ofthe Council has been bestowed with the power of removal of the member from the Council. If that isthe case than it can be held that in the absence of any provision in the Act the above mentionedauthorities have no power to remove the member from the Council. The government is the onlyauthority to remove the member from the Council and none else in terms of Section 19 of the Act.No other authority can assume the power of the government to remove any member from theCouncil. The argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the order of suspension hasbeen passed by the competent authority in terms of the Act cannot prime facie sustain in the eyes oflaw.8. Once the court holds that the provisions of the Act do not provide for the suspension of themember from the Council the question of vesting of power to suspend in any of the authoritymentioned in the Act does not arise.9. Learned counsel for the respondents has vehemently argued that the petitioner is involved in asedition case and the interest of country has been jeopardized by the petitioner through his action', 'the order of suspension passed by the respondents is valid one. In case the order impugned is stayedthe same shall not be in the security of the State. Learned counsel for the respondents has also takenrefuge under Section 24 of the J&amp;K Representation of the People Act in order to impress upon thecourt that Section 24 of Jammu and Kashmir Representation of the People Act', ' 1957 prescribesdisqualification of the member from the Council for the acts mentioned in the said section. It ispertinent to note that Section 24 pertains 6 WP(C) 1645/2020 CM No. 4635/2020 todisqualification of a convicted person from the membership who has been convicted for the periodmentioned in the said section. It does not refer to suspension of the member from the Council. Itmay also be noted that Section 17 of the LAHDC Act refers to disqualification as member of theZakir Hussain vs Union Territory Of J&amp;K And Others on 4 December', ' 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/162108487/3'], ['Council on the ground if he has been convicted for an offence involving moral turpitude or anoffence mentioned in Section 24 of the J&amp;K Representation of the People Act', ' 1957. The argument oflearned counsel for the respondents has no relevancy in the present case as the question ofdisqualification is not in picture in the present case. Learned counsel for the petitioner hassubmitted that reference to Section 24 of the J&amp;K Representation of the People Act by the learnedcounsel for the respondents is of no avail as the said Act stands repealed in pursuance to cominginto force of J&amp;K Reorganization Act', ' 2019. The court is of the view that in any case the reference tothe provisions as mentioned by the learned counsel for the respondents has no relevancy to the issuein hand.10. The argument of the learned counsel for the respondents that the acts of the petitionerjeopardized the security of the State and therefore the suspension of the petitioner from the Councilis otherwise justified cannot be agreed to by the Court as the provisions of the Act do not provide forsuspension of the member from the Council as held above. The charges against the petitioner are yetto be proved and the court cannot make comment on this aspect of the case.11. To summarize', \" the court has held that the provisions of the Act do not provide for suspension ofthe member from the Council and that in any case the authorities recommending the suspensionand the authority passing the impugned order of suspension do not have power for suspension 7WP(C) 1645/2020 CM No. 4635/2020 under the Act even if it is to be presumed for the sake ofargument that the term 'removal' includes 'suspension' of the member from the Council.12. In view of the discussion made above\", ' the court finds that the petitioner has been able to makeout a case for stay of the impugned order', ' passed by the respondent No. 5. The petitioner cannot bedebarred from discharging his functions as member of the Council. Accordingly', ' the orderimpugned in the writ petition', ' passed by the respondent No. 5', ' is stayed till further orders. Theorder passed by the court shall not come in the way of the respondents to take any appropriateaction against the petitioner as per the provisions of law. It is also made clear that observationsmade in the order are confined to the disposal of the interim application and shall have no bearingon the merits of the main petition. The application of interim relief is disposed of.13. The writ petition is admitted. Counter', ' if any', ' be filed by the respondents by the next date.14.

On the basis of this information', ' thesubject FIR was registered by the police and investigation of the case was set into motion. Duringthe investigation of the case', ' an audio clip of 6.3 minutes duration wasseized and it was found tocontain a conversation between the petitioner/accused', ' Zakir Hussain', ' and co-accused NissarAhmad Khan. The conversation contains extremely objectionable expressions and sentencesallegedly used by the petitioner against the Country', ' its leadership as well as against the IndianArmed Forces. Accordingly', ' the petitioner was arrested on 19.06.2020.6) So far as the contents of the transcript of conversation alleged to have been made by thepetitioner are concerned', ' prima facie', ' it appears that the petitioner has used certain expressions andsentences in the said conversation which are extremely objectionable. Certain parts of theconversation are not only derogatory against the leadership of the Country but even against theArmed Forces of the Country and there are certain other portions of the conversation alleged to havebeen made by the petitioner which go against the sovereignty and integrity of the Country.7) Learned counsel for the petitioner has vehemently contended that even if it is assumed that thepetitioner had made the conversation and uploaded the same on the social media', ' still then theoffence MOHAMMAD ALTAF BHAT 2020.09.24 16:06 I attest to the accuracy and integrity of thisdocument under Section 124A and 153A of IPC is not made out against the petitioner. According tohim', ' in order to make out a case under Section 124A of IPC', ' it is necessary that the offensiveremarks or speech should lead to some sort of violence or agitation from the public', ' which is not thecase here. The learned counsel petitioner has relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court inBalwant Singh and Anr. vs State of Punjab reported in (1995) 3 SCC 214 to bring home this point.He has referred to the following observations of the Supreme Court contained in paras 8 and 9 ofthe aforesaid judgment:\"8.Section 124A IPC reads thus:\"124A. Sedition - whoever by words', ' either spoken or written', ' or by signs', ' or byvisible representation', ' or otherwise', ' brings or attempts to bring into hatred orcontempt', ' or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards', ' the Governmentestablished by law in India', ' shall be punished with imprisonment for life', ' to whichfate may be added', ' or with imprisonment which may extend to three years', ' to whichfine may be added', ' or with fine.Explanation 1 - The expression \"disaffection\" includes disloyalty and all feelings ofenmity.Zakir Hussain vs Ut Of Ladakh Through Director ... on 24 September', ' 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/174526893/2'], ['Explanation 2 - Comments expressing disapprobation of the measures of theGovernment with a view to obtain their alteration by Lawful means', ' without excitingor attempting to excite hatred', ' contempt or disaffection', ' do not constitute an offenceunder this section.Explanation 3 - Comments expressing disapprobation of the administrative or otheraction of the Government without exciting or attempting to excite hatred', ' contemptor disaffection', ' do not constitute an offence tinder this Section.\"A plain reading of the above Section would show that its application would be attracted only whenthe accused MOHAMMAD ALTAF BHAT 2020.09.24 16:06 I attest to the accuracy and integrity ofthis document brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt or excites or attempts to excitedisaffection towards the Government established by law in India', ' by words either written or spokenor visible signs or representations etc. Keeping in view the prosecution evidence that the slogans asnoticed above were raised a couple of times only by the appellant and that neither the slogansevoked a response from any other person of the Sikh community or reaction from people of othercommunities', ' we find it difficult to hold that upon the raising of such casual slogans', ' a couple oftimes without any other act whatsoever the charge of sedition can be founded. It is not theprosecution case that the appellants were either leading a procession or were otherwise raising theslogans with the intention to incite people to create disorder or that the slogans in fact created anylaw and order problem. It does not appear to us that the police should have attached muchsignificance to the casual slogans raised by two appellants', ' a couple of times and read to much intothem. The prosecution has admitted that no disturbance', ' whatsoever', ' was caused by the raising ofthe slogans by the appellants and that inspite of the fact that the appellants raised the slogans acouple of times', ' the people', ' in general', ' were un-affected and carried on with their normal activities.The casual raising of the Slogans', ' once or twice by two individuals alone cannot be said to be aimedat exciting or attempt to excite hatred or disaffection towards the Government as established by lawin India', ' Section 124A IPC', ' would in the facts and circumstances of the case have no applicationwhatsoever and would not be attracted to the facts and circumstances of the case.9. In so far as the offence under Section 153A IPC is concerned', ' it provides for punishment forpromoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion', ' race', ' place of birth', ' residence', 'language', ' caste or community or any other ground whatsoever or brings about disharmony orfeeling of hatred or ill-will between different religious', ' racial', ' language or regional groups or castesor communities. In our opinion only where the written or spoken words have the tendency orintention of creating public disorder or disturbance of law and order or effect public tranquility', ' thatthe law needs to step in to prevent such an activity. The facts and circumstances of this caseunmistakably show that there was no disturbance or semblance of disturbance of law and order or ofpublic order or peace and tranquility in the area from where the appellants were apprehended whileraising slogans on account of the activities of the appellants. The intention to MOHAMMAD ALTAFBHAT 2020.09.24 16:06 I attest to the accuracy and integrity of this document cause disorder orincite people to violence is the sine qua non of the offence under Section 153 A IPC and theprosecution has to prove the existence of mens rea in order to succeed. In this case', ' the prosecutionhas not been able to establish any mens rea on the part of the appellants', ' as envisaged by theZakir Hussain vs Ut Of Ladakh Through Director ... on 24 September', ' 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/174526893/3'], ['provisions of Section 153A IPC', ' by their raising causally the three slogans a couple of times. Theoffence under Section 153A IPC is', ' therefore', ' not made out.\"8) From the aforesaid observations of the Supreme Court', ' it is clear that mere expression ofderogatory or objectionable words may not be a sufficient ground for invoking the provisionscontained in Section 124A or 153A of IPC. The said provisions would apply only when the written orspoken words have the tendency or intention of creating disorder or disturbance of public peace byresort to violence. It will be premature for this Court to comment on the question whether thealleged conversation made by the petitioner and uploaded on the social media has the tendency ofcreating disorder or disturbance of public peace by resort to violence. The same has to be consideredby the trial court while framing charge against the petitioner', ' against whom', ' the challan is stated tohave been filed during the pendency of this bail petition.9) As noted above', ' the challan in the case has been filed', ' which means that the investigation of thecase is complete. The petitioner is not alleged to have committed an offence which carries capitalpunishment', ' as such', ' the rigor of Section 437(1)(i) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not attractedto the instant case. Besides this', ' the petitioner is an elected representative of LAHDC having deepMOHAMMAD ALTAF BHAT 2020.09.24 16:06 I attest to the accuracy and integrity of thisdocument roots in the community', ' as such', ' the chances of his fleeing from justice are very remote.10) Apart from what is observed in the foregoing para', ' the Case Diary shows that immediately aftercommission of alleged offence by the petitioner', ' he has published a public apology and expressed hisregrets. This conduct of the petitioner subsequent to the commission of alleged offence', ' lendsassurance against repetition of similar offence by the petitioner.11) For the foregoing reasons', ' this petition is accepted and the petitioner is admitted to bail subjectto the following conditions:(I) That he shall furnish personal bond with one surety in the sum of Rs.50', '000/ tothe satisfaction of the trial court;(II) That he shall appear on each and every date of hearing before the trial court;(III) That he shall not tamper with prosecution witnesses; (IV) That he shall not leavethe territorial limits of Union Territory of Ladakh without prior permission of thetrial court.12) Copy of this order be supplied to the learned counsel for the petitioner through available mode.(Sanjay Dhar) Judge Srinagar 24.09.2020 \"BhatAltaf', ' PS\"                                            Whether the order is speaking:          Yes/No                                            Whether the order is reportable:        Yes/NoMOHAMMAD ALTAF BHATZakir Hussain vs Ut Of Ladakh Through Director ... on 24 September', ' 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/174526893/4'], ['2020.09.24 16:06I attest to the accuracy andintegrity of this documentZakir Hussain vs Ut Of Ladakh Through Director ... on 24 September', ' 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/174526893/5']]</td>\n",

The petitioner has challenged order bearing No. DCK/Suspension-Councillor/2020-2 dated25.06.2020', ' passed by respondent No. 5', ' whereby the petitioner has been suspended fromdischarging his functions as councilor of Hill Development Council', ' Kargil. The stay of orderimpugned as measure of interim relief is sought for by the petitioner. The reply to the petition hasbeen filed on behalf of the respondents.2. The petitioner has been elected as Councillor of Shakar constituency of LAHDC', ' Kargil. It ispleaded by the petitioner that FIR came to be lodged against the petitioner on false allegations. Thebail application filed by the petitioner was allowed by this Court on the ground that prima facie theessential elements of law are not attracted in the present case. The contention raised by thepetitioner is that the respondent No. 5 has no power to suspend the petitioner as councillor as perLadakh Autonomous Hill 2 WP(C) 1645/2020 CM No. 4635/2020 Development Councils', ' Act(hereinafter called the Act) and therefore the order passed is without jurisdiction. It is furthercontended that the Act does not provide suspension of councillor from the Council. Despiterepresentation made by the petitioner the revocation of suspension of the petitioner has not takenplace which has compelled the petitioner to file the present writ petition.3. In the objections filed by the respondents it is submitted that the executive Council in its meetingheld on 20.06.2020 under the Chairmanship of Chief Executive Councillor LAHDC', ' Kargilsuspended the petitioner and suspension order was passed on the recommendation ofChairman/CEO LAHDC. FIR No. 34/2020 was lodged against the petitioner under Sections 124A', 'Zakir Hussain vs Union Territory Of J&K And Others on 4 December', ' 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/162108487/1'], ['153B', ' 505(2) and 188 IPC by the police Station', ' Kargil on the basis of objectionable audio clipcontaining seditious and proactive conversation and imputation and rumors against the Armystand-off with Chinese Army in Ladakh which was found to be prejudicial to the tranquility andsecurity of the nation. The petitioner was in conversation with one Nisar Hussain in this regard. It isfurther contended that Section 24 of Jammu and Kashmir Representation of the People Act', ' 1957regards disloyalty to the State as one of the grounds for suspension of petitioner under Section 17 ofLAHDC Act.4. Heard learned counsel for the parties.5. Indeed', \" the learned counsels for both sides have advanced the arguments in tune with theirrespective pleadings. In order to appreciate the grievance of the petitioner qua the order impugnedin the petition it is profitable to analyze if the Act provides for suspension of the Councillor from thecouncil. In case the reply is to be in affirmative the next question for 3 WP(C) 1645/2020 CM No.4635/2020 determination is if the order impugned has been passed by the competent authority interms of the Act.6. Section 19 of the Act speaks of removal of the Member of the Council on the grounds mentionedtherein. The grounds on which the member can be removed are: the member is convicted by anyCourt for an offence involving moral turpitude punishable with imprisonment for a period of morethan six months or he has been adjudged as insolvent or he has become physically or mentallyincapable of acting as a member and lastly if has acquired such financial or other interests which islikely to affect prejudicially his functions as a member. The clauses of the said Section do not admitof the removal of the member of Council on any other ground except on the grounds mentionedtherein. The court has gone through the provisions of the Act and finds no provision in the Actwhich expressly provides for suspension of the member of the Council. Once there is no provisionfor suspension of the member from the Council then irrespective of the reason which the competentauthority may consider sufficient for suspension of the member cannot suspend the member fromthe Council. The suspension cannot be equated with removal. Even if it is considered for the sake ofarguments that 'removal' encompasses the 'suspension' the reasons for suspension cannot bebeyond the clauses mentioned in Section 19 of the Act. The court cannot look beyond to what isprovided in the Act. If the provisions of the Act do not expressly or even impliedly provide forsuspension of the member from the Council than in that case the court is not required to expand theprovisions so as to hold that the provisions of the Act provide for suspension of the member fromthe Council.                                       4                  WP(C) 1645/2020                                                         CM No. 4635/20207. The petitioner has further pleaded that the petitioner has not been\", ' in any case', ' suspended by thecompetent authority if it is to be presumed for the sake of argument that the person/authorityZakir Hussain vs Union Territory Of J&K And Others on 4 December', ' 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/162108487/2'], ['having power to remove the member can also suspend the member from the Council. The other sidehas contended that the order of suspension of the petitioner was passed by the respondent No. 5 onthe recommendation of the Chairman/Chief Executive Councillor in pursuance to the decision takenby the executive Council in its meeting held on 20.06.2020. The court is again required to revert tothe provisions of the Act. Section 23 pertains to the matters under the control and administration ofthe Council. The powers which the Council can exercise are clearly delineated in the clauses (i) to(xxvii) of the said section. In addition', ' the government can confer other powers upon the Council.Again', ' the court finds no such power is vested in the Council to remove its member from theCouncil. In fact the power of removal of member from the Council lies within the domain of thegovernment and no other authority in terms of Section 19 of the Act. Section 28 of the Act prescribespowers', ' functions and duties of the Chairman of the Council. As per the Section the Chairman canpreside over the meeting of the councilor and is also responsible for the maintenance of the recordof the Council. Further', ' he can perform such other functions and discharge such other duties as theCouncil may', ' by general or special resolution', ' direct. The other provision which may be required tobe looked into for the purpose of discussion is Section 38 of the Act. Deputy Commissioner of thedistrict is the Chief Executive Officer of the Councillor. Section 38(2) provides that the ChiefExecutive Officer can be present at the meeting of the Council', ' the Executive Council and can alsotake part in the proceedings of such meeting but he has no right to vote during the proceedings ofthe meetings. What is 5 WP(C) 1645/2020 CM No. 4635/2020 fathomed from various provisions ofthe Act is that neither the Council nor the Chairman of the Council nor the Chief Executive Officer ofthe Council has been bestowed with the power of removal of the member from the Council. If that isthe case than it can be held that in the absence of any provision in the Act the above mentionedauthorities have no power to remove the member from the Council. The government is the onlyauthority to remove the member from the Council and none else in terms of Section 19 of the Act.No other authority can assume the power of the government to remove any member from theCouncil. The argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the order of suspension hasbeen passed by the competent authority in terms of the Act cannot prime facie sustain in the eyes oflaw.8. Once the court holds that the provisions of the Act do not provide for the suspension of themember from the Council the question of vesting of power to suspend in any of the authoritymentioned in the Act does not arise.9. Learned counsel for the respondents has vehemently argued that the petitioner is involved in asedition case and the interest of country has been jeopardized by the petitioner through his action', 'the order of suspension passed by the respondents is valid one. In case the order impugned is stayedthe same shall not be in the security of the State. Learned counsel for the respondents has also takenrefuge under Section 24 of the J&K Representation of the People Act in order to impress upon thecourt that Section 24 of Jammu and Kashmir Representation of the People Act', ' 1957 prescribesdisqualification of the member from the Council for the acts mentioned in the said section. It ispertinent to note that Section 24 pertains 6 WP(C) 1645/2020 CM No. 4635/2020 todisqualification of a convicted person from the membership who has been convicted for the periodmentioned in the said section. It does not refer to suspension of the member from the Council. Itmay also be noted that Section 17 of the LAHDC Act refers to disqualification as member of theZakir Hussain vs Union Territory Of J&K And Others on 4 December', ' 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/162108487/3'], ['Council on the ground if he has been convicted for an offence involving moral turpitude or anoffence mentioned in Section 24 of the J&K Representation of the People Act', ' 1957. The argument oflearned counsel for the respondents has no relevancy in the present case as the question ofdisqualification is not in picture in the present case. Learned counsel for the petitioner hassubmitted that reference to Section 24 of the J&K Representation of the People Act by the learnedcounsel for the respondents is of no avail as the said Act stands repealed in pursuance to cominginto force of J&K Reorganization Act', ' 2019. The court is of the view that in any case the reference tothe provisions as mentioned by the learned counsel for the respondents has no relevancy to the issuein hand.10. The argument of the learned counsel for the respondents that the acts of the petitionerjeopardized the security of the State and therefore the suspension of the petitioner from the Councilis otherwise justified cannot be agreed to by the Court as the provisions of the Act do not provide forsuspension of the member from the Council as held above. The charges against the petitioner are yetto be proved and the court cannot make comment on this aspect of the case.11. To summarize', \" the court has held that the provisions of the Act do not provide for suspension ofthe member from the Council and that in any case the authorities recommending the suspensionand the authority passing the impugned order of suspension do not have power for suspension 7WP(C) 1645/2020 CM No. 4635/2020 under the Act even if it is to be presumed for the sake ofargument that the term 'removal' includes 'suspension' of the member from the Council.12. In view of the discussion made above\", ' the court finds that the petitioner has been able to makeout a case for stay of the impugned order', ' passed by the respondent No. 5. The petitioner cannot bedebarred from discharging his functions as member of the Council. Accordingly', ' the orderimpugned in the writ petition', ' passed by the respondent No. 5', ' is stayed till further orders. Theorder passed by the court shall not come in the way of the respondents to take any appropriateaction against the petitioner as per the provisions of law. It is also made clear that observationsmade in the order are confined to the disposal of the interim application and shall have no bearingon the merits of the main petition. The application of interim relief is disposed of.13. The writ petition is admitted. Counter', ' if any', ' be filed by the respondents by the next date.14.

On the basis of this information', ' thesubject FIR was registered by the police and investigation of the case was set into motion. Duringthe investigation of the case', ' an audio clip of 6.3 minutes duration wasseized and it was found tocontain a conversation between the petitioner/accused', ' Zakir Hussain', ' and co-accused NissarAhmad Khan. The conversation contains extremely objectionable expressions and sentencesallegedly used by the petitioner against the Country', ' its leadership as well as against the IndianArmed Forces. Accordingly', ' the petitioner was arrested on 19.06.2020.6) So far as the contents of the transcript of conversation alleged to have been made by thepetitioner are concerned', ' prima facie', ' it appears that the petitioner has used certain expressions andsentences in the said conversation which are extremely objectionable. Certain parts of theconversation are not only derogatory against the leadership of the Country but even against theArmed Forces of the Country and there are certain other portions of the conversation alleged to havebeen made by the petitioner which go against the sovereignty and integrity of the Country.7) Learned counsel for the petitioner has vehemently contended that even if it is assumed that thepetitioner had made the conversation and uploaded the same on the social media', ' still then theoffence MOHAMMAD ALTAF BHAT 2020.09.24 16:06 I attest to the accuracy and integrity of thisdocument under Section 124A and 153A of IPC is not made out against the petitioner. According tohim', ' in order to make out a case under Section 124A of IPC', ' it is necessary that the offensiveremarks or speech should lead to some sort of violence or agitation from the public', ' which is not thecase here. The learned counsel petitioner has relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court inBalwant Singh and Anr. vs State of Punjab reported in (1995) 3 SCC 214 to bring home this point.He has referred to the following observations of the Supreme Court contained in paras 8 and 9 ofthe aforesaid judgment:\"8.Section 124A IPC reads thus:\"124A.

It is not theprosecution case that the appellants were either leading a procession or were otherwise raising theslogans with the intention to incite people to create disorder or that the slogans in fact created anylaw and order problem. It does not appear to us that the police should have attached muchsignificance to the casual slogans raised by two appellants', ' a couple of times and read to much intothem. The prosecution has admitted that no disturbance', ' whatsoever', ' was caused by the raising ofthe slogans by the appellants and that inspite of the fact that the appellants raised the slogans acouple of times', ' the people', ' in general', ' were un-affected and carried on with their normal activities.The casual raising of the Slogans', ' once or twice by two individuals alone cannot be said to be aimedat exciting or attempt to excite hatred or disaffection towards the Government as established by lawin India', ' Section 124A IPC', ' would in the facts and circumstances of the case have no applicationwhatsoever and would not be attracted to the facts and circumstances of the case.9. In so far as the offence under Section 153A IPC is concerned', ' it provides for punishment forpromoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion', ' race', ' place of birth', ' residence', 'language', ' caste or community or any other ground whatsoever or brings about disharmony orfeeling of hatred or ill-will between different religious', ' racial', ' language or regional groups or castesor communities. In our opinion only where the written or spoken words have the tendency orintention of creating public disorder or disturbance of law and order or effect public tranquility', ' thatthe law needs to step in to prevent such an activity. The facts and circumstances of this caseunmistakably show that there was no disturbance or semblance of disturbance of law and order or ofpublic order or peace and tranquility in the area from where the appellants were apprehended whileraising slogans on account of the activities of the appellants. The intention to MOHAMMAD ALTAFBHAT 2020.09.24 16:06 I attest to the accuracy and integrity of this document cause disorder orincite people to violence is the sine qua non of the offence under Section 153 A IPC and theprosecution has to prove the existence of mens rea in order to succeed. In this case', ' the prosecutionhas not been able to establish any mens rea on the part of the appellants', ' as envisaged by theZakir Hussain vs Ut Of Ladakh Through Director ... on 24 September', ' 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/174526893/3'], ['provisions of Section 153A IPC', ' by their raising causally the three slogans a couple of times. Theoffence under Section 153A IPC is', ' therefore', ' not made out.\"8) From the aforesaid observations of the Supreme Court', ' it is clear that mere expression ofderogatory or objectionable words may not be a sufficient ground for invoking the provisionscontained in Section 124A or 153A of IPC. The said provisions would apply only when the written orspoken words have the tendency or intention of creating disorder or disturbance of public peace byresort to violence. It will be premature for this Court to comment on the question whether thealleged conversation made by the petitioner and uploaded on the social media has the tendency ofcreating disorder or disturbance of public peace by resort to violence. The same has to be consideredby the trial court while framing charge against the petitioner', ' against whom', ' the challan is stated tohave been filed during the pendency of this bail petition.9) As noted above', ' the challan in the case has been filed', ' which means that the investigation of thecase is complete. The petitioner is not alleged to have committed an offence which carries capitalpunishment', ' as such', ' the rigor of Section 437(1)(i) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not attractedto the instant case. Besides this', ' the petitioner is an elected representative of LAHDC having deepMOHAMMAD ALTAF BHAT 2020.09.24 16:06 I attest to the accuracy and integrity of thisdocument roots in the community', ' as such', ' the chances of his fleeing from justice are very remote.10) Apart from what is observed in the foregoing para', ' the Case Diary shows that immediately aftercommission of alleged offence by the petitioner', ' he has published a public apology and expressed hisregrets. This conduct of the petitioner subsequent to the commission of alleged offence', ' lendsassurance against repetition of similar offence by the petitioner.11) For the foregoing reasons', ' this petition is accepted and the petitioner is admitted to bail subjectto the following conditions:(I) That he shall furnish personal bond with one surety in the sum of Rs.50', '000/ tothe satisfaction of the trial court;(II) That he shall appear on each and every date of hearing before the trial court;(III) That he shall not tamper with prosecution witnesses; (IV) That he shall not leavethe territorial limits of Union Territory of Ladakh without prior permission of thetrial court.12) Copy of this order be supplied to the learned counsel for the petitioner through available mode.(Sanjay Dhar) Judge Srinagar 24.09.2020 \"BhatAltaf', ' PS\"                                            Whether the order is speaking:          Yes/No                                            Whether the order is reportable:        Yes/NoMOHAMMAD ALTAF BHATZakir Hussain vs Ut Of Ladakh Through Director ... on 24 September', ' 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/174526893/4'], ['2020.09.24 16:06I attest to the accuracy andintegrity of this documentZakir Hussain vs Ut Of Ladakh Through Director ... on 24 September', ' 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/174526893/5']]  \n",

We have noticed thatthe issue before the Supreme Court in N.M.T.

The Apex Court afterconsidering the Page No.# 14/21 land mark decision in the case of Madhu Limaye v.(The State ) The National ... vs Shri Akhil Gogoi on 7 April', ' 2020Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/186197749/9'], ['State of Maharashtra reported in AIR 1978 SC 47 and Amar Nath v.

In the considered opinion of the Court', ' an important issue of law has arisen', ' which requiresdetailed consideration.
